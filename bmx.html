                <h4>Local Family Oriented Racing Team</h4>
                <p>The greatest gift we can give ourselves and future generations is the bond of family, whether it is a relative or a friend. BMX is an individual sport, the race results depend on the amount of effort and hard work you are willing to give. But the greatest asset to a racer is having a team encouraging and helping improve skills every day. This local team consists of mainly families of 2+ racers, whether siblings or parent/child relations, along with supportive parents and grandparents to help them continue this sport that they love. Beyond having family on the team, the team actually becomes your "family!" These are bonds that I hope the kids carry with them into adulthood,shaping them for the amazing person they are and will be.<br>
                    Please visit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057261918166">Chaos Team Racing></a> page to learn about Team Chaos and watch their continued journey,
                </p>
                <p>Covid had a big impact on the sport of BMX in 2020. Even though there were many tracks unable to open for entire outdoor racing season, Team Chaos maintained a weekly schedule to practice 1-3 times a week (within "covid-approved" restrictions.) Consistent practice provided the riders great benefit by remaining active while also improve their skills with fellow team members. <br>
                    Fortunately there were a few tracks able to host races with "covid-restrictions" and when opportunities presented themselves, the team was able to travel safely together and compete.<br>

                </p>
                <p>Hopefully you have a great "family" surrounding you, whether related by blood or simply common interest.
